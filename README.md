Whoa, just stepped out of the theater. Still kinda buzzing from “The Parenting.” Weird how you can cram so many emotions — like squirrels hoarding nuts for winter. Need to tell you all about it, like right now, but my thumb’s got a mind of its own. So here goes.

First off, that opening scene was like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 cats trying to herd dogs. Chaotic. But that’s the thing about parenting, right? It’s juggling porcupines in a bathtub. So much noise. Felt like I was in a sardine can, scrunched up against the sticky seat back with popcorn being a rogue explorer in every crevice.

> This one bit — this heart-wrenching moment about a father and his son — it’s stuck with me. You remember that feeling when you try to get a kitten out of a tree? Yeah, like that. Desperate and tender and just a little ridiculous. I was holding my breath... almost forgot where I was. Forgetting my back ache, the buildup of aches from sitting like a pretzel.

And then it kinda hit me, the resemblance to surgeries. In the kind of dramatic Sundays when I get a frantic call about a parrot swallowing something shiny. Each scene has this kind of feverish urgency. The 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 did that so well — brought back those memories like a breeze full of dander and feathers.

Someone said something about where to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , uh. Well, dunno but you gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it the old-fashioned way. You know, front and center, where your emotions are captive. Feels like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a puppy chase its tail on repeat. Pure, unadulterated chaos and love.

Random thought: the pacing was kinda how I imagined an aardvark might move in a land of molasses and just as odd as thinking of cloud patterns while trying to diagnose a sneezing ferret.

The more I think, the more it feels like the   played my heart like a harp — outta tune but still beautiful in its own messy way. The popcorn crumbs on my lap remind me of the scattered bits of storyline that somehow just work together.
